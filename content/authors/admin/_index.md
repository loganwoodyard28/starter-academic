I am a researcher with longstanding roots in the lumber industry as I come from a lineage of Appalachian loggers, mill owners, and operators. My passion for strengthening the ever-changing forest economy in addition to my experience with data analysis leads me to pursue opportunities as an analyst in the wood products industry.
